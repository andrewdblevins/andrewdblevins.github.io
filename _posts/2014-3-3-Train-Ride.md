title: Singapore to Scotland by train
---




Things I lost on this trip:
My credit card, and my debit card
about 40lbs
caution while crossing the street. (Also I am not sure which way to look now)
the ability to drink brandy (I blame the Russians)
The soles of my shoes.
fear of drowning

Things I gained on this trip:
a love of thai and vietnamese cuisine, and real japanese Ramen
some incredible memories
appreciation for the importance of culture, and the differences and similarities around the world
new appreciation for flush toilets and clean air




This is the route we ended up taking. From Singapore to Scotland by train. All told we did well over 11000 miles by train.
