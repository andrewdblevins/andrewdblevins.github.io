## Our first major train

From Johor, we hopped onto a train to Kuala Lumpur. I thought I had grabbed the front most seats, but instead I got the rear most seats. This gave us a fine view out the back.

Kuala Lumpur

One of the first things we noticed about Kuala Lumpur is that there was construction every where we looked. San Francisco could certainly learn something from Kuala Lumpur. From any one spot you could see 8-10 cranes. I really like construction. After the Bay area it was a refreshing site. And yet, it didn't quite feel right.

There were grand malls, but it didn't feel like people were out shopping in them. The state religion ensured that there was no night life in the town to speak of. The place had a bit of a ghost town feel, like I imagine Dubai must be like. I think they are both towns that exist because someone powerful decided to build a city.

and they built a monorail
Most of the sky scrapers are office buildings, but with a commercial occupancy rate between 80% and 70%, maybe building more isn't the right decision. another thing that confuses me it how you can have a occupancy rate that low, but housing prices are still 5.5 times median income. I would expect prices to fall to deal with the surplus. It feels like a market being propped up. Yet they are still building like crazy. I wonder where the capital for all those cranes is coming from? Probably from those suckers who invest all their money in emerging market mutual funds... like me... hmm...

Still, they have some really cool towers

There is steep alcohol tax, which means I paid California prices for this margarita.
Batu Caves

a bit north of Kuala Lumpur is a Limestone Karst with an extensive cave system. One of the two main caves is a hindu temple, the other is a nature preserve, home to a number of endemic species including an ancient type of trap-door spider.

the macaque monkeys were the most fun though. They were every where and completely unimpressed with people, who they view as food dispensers.IMG_20160113_122603

Monkeys have learned that yummy things come in bags. Sean was just getting sun screen, they came running when he started to unzip his bag.

A45 minute guided tour of the caves was available and well worth it. The floor is completely covered in bat guano and the ceiling in bats. There are so good bits of flow stone, and places where the natural shape of the cave creates a good breeze.IMG_20160113_133301

light streams through holes in the ceiling at certain times of day. Like Indiana Jones. We left our laser staff at home though :(
